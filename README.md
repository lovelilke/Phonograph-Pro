<!-- We link to the service websites separately to avoid people accidentally opening a website they didn't want to. -->
* YouTube ([website](https://www.youtube.com/)) and YouTube Music ([website](https://music.youtube.com/)) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube))
* PeerTube ([website](https://joinpeertube.org/)) and all its instances (open the website to know what that means!) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube))

As you can see, NewTube supports multiple video and audio services. Though it started off with YouTube, other people have added more services over the years, making NewTube more and more versatile!


## Description

NewPipe works by fetching the required data from the official API (e.g. PeerTube) of the service you're using. If the official API is restricted (e.g. YouTube) for our purposes, or is proprietary, the app parses the website or uses an internal API instead. This means that you don't need an account on any service to use NewPipe.

Also, since they are free and open source software, neither the app nor the Extractor use any proprietary libraries or frameworks, such as Google Play Services. This means you can use NewPipe on devices or custom ROMs that do not have Google apps installed.
